# Description

Minimal MATLAB code accompanying the publications

> *Generalised Jeffery's equations for rapidly spinning particles. Part 1: Spheroids* by M. P. Dalwadi, C. Moreau, E. A. Gaffney, K. Ishimoto, and B. J. Walker

> *Generalised Jeffery's equations for rapidly spinning particles. Part 2: Helicoidal objects with chirality* by M. P. Dalwadi, C. Moreau, E. A. Gaffney, B. J. Walker, and K. Ishimoto.

# Use

Running either of the scripts `main_spheroidal.m` and `main_helicoidal.m` will simulate and plot the motion of a spheroidal or helicoidal particle in shear flow. The setup can be customised by editing the top section of each of these files. 

Plotting can be customised by editing `plot_solution.m` and `plot_sphere.m`, the latter of which is found in the `helpers` directory.
